# TinyRenderer-en-VTK

The aim of this repository is to recreate Dmitry V. Sokolov's TinyRenderer images ( https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer ) using VTK. The goal is to use this as a transition from the first 4 weeks of my VTK lecture based on TinyRenderer into VTK proper. 

The code in this repository is presented (in French) in this video: https://youtu.be/Vy-mRs7J4-c
